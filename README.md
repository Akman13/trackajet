# ElonJet Project

## Introduction
ElonJet is a flight tracking project created by a team of four developers using React and Google Maps API. The project involved working with the OpenSky API to fetch real-time flight data and displaying them on a Google Map.

## Organisation
At the start of the project, we created a wire-frame and a Trello board to organise ourselves. We divided the workload based on strengths, and also on interest on which challenges we wanted to take on, with each member of the team assigned tasks such as UI/UX design, API integration, front-end, and back-end development.

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges we faced was dealing with API issues. There were times when the OpenSky API came to the limitations of the free versions request limits, making it impossible to fetch flight data. To solve this issue, we created multiple logins in order to continue development, we also implemented a contingency plan by having a backup API that we could switch to if the primary API was unavailable.

## Trello Board
To keep track of our progress, we created a Trello board with different columns such as “To-Do,” “In-Progress,” “Testing,” and “Completed.” Each task was assigned a due date and labeled with the name of the person responsible for it. The board made it easy for us to track progress and know which tasks needed to be done. Especially during times when we were having difficulty finishing or bug fixing certain tasks.

## Packages and APIs
Various packages and APIs were needed to build the project. We used the React Google Maps API to integrate Google Maps into our application. The package allowed us to display markers and flight data on the map. We also used the OpenSky API to fetch real-time flight data.

## Styling
We used basic CSS to style the application. The color scheme we chose was a timeless blue, grey, and white. Using different shades of blue to differentiate between different flight markers. We also added a search bar that allowed users to search for specific flights.
